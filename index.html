                    The computer will select a random number at the start of the game. The player has a choice between 4 different crystals.
                    Clicking each will add a random number to the player's total score. If your score goes and matches that of the computer
                    choosen number, you will win. But if you pass the number, you will lose. Each crystal will have a certain number, but you
                    will not know what it is until you press it. These numbers won't have the same value everygame, when you restart the game 
                    the numbers will also change.
